# Digital Coffee Setup

Semester setup requirements:

1. Close off the `#class-selection` channel so everyone isn't spammed while setting up channels.
2. Create channels for each class under the "Flavors" category. 
3. Create the role for each class as well. We recommend using the class short code, such as `CSC232` for the rolename.
     * For each class role, make sure that the "everyone" role cannot see the class channel, then allow each class role to be able to view the channel. 
4. Post the formatted message(s) in `#class-selection`, splitting up using the `divider.gif` image in this repository. Use the "Digital Coffee" account to do this. 
5. The reaction role is configured through through [Carl-bot](https://carl.gg/). You will want to login and manage the digital coffee server from their website.
  * Once on the manage page, navigate to `Reaction Roles` -> Create new Reaction Role
  * From here, you will want to do each section of messages you posted. Study this example carefully:

6. Once you submit, reaction role will automatically add each reaction to each message. You will want to test by clicking each reaction role and making sure you are added to the correct role for each reaction.
7. Reopen the `#class-selection` channel.
